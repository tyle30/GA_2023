This is the structure of my folders. There will be three main folders - analyses, code and data. 
Analyses will contain preprocessing, assembly and annotation and etc.
Code will contain all the code that will be used in the project.
Data will contain all the data that is used in the project, i.e. Metadata, raw data and trimmed data.
